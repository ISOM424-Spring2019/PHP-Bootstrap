# Project Title

This is a .zip file for people to start working with Twitter's Bootstrap and PHP. I set it up to make it easy for beginners to set up their first website. It contains default Bootstrap resources, a header file, and an index file.

## Getting Started

Download the zip file, unzip it, and then run it either on a personal webserver (locally on online) (if you don't know how to do this, I recommend downloading [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/)). You could also run this on an Amazon EC2 Instance (more techincal, but better) or a GoDaddy-hosted server (easy, but expensive and kind of clunky).

## Built With

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) - Twitter Bootstrap's docs. Check these out to learn how to do whatever you need.
